# First Milestone: 
For the first milestone, I did have many troubel finding out how to build the car. I asked my mentor, who thankfully knew how to build it, and I managed to get my car looking somewhat like a car within the first week.


# Second Milestone
This milestone was extremly knowledgeable, this is the first time I've ever souldered using a souldering iron. While holding a 500 degrees fahrenheit stick in your hand might sound quite dangerous, it is very safe, even if it did come close to touching my hand several times. I also left the wires wired into the batter, which then started to smoke. This of course made me nervouse but I managed to solve the issue with just a burn on my hand that went away after a few days. I also wrote some code for the motion sensor, which worked, thanks to the help of my mentor.


# Final Milestone
  
For the final milestone, I finally figured out what my biggest roadblock was. It was the wiring. It might seem simple, just connect from point A to point B, but with the amount of wires blocking your eyesight, it can be extremly frustrating and difficult to put the wires into the right place. Even if you did, making the wires stay in the outlit was no easy task, since it kept slipping out even after using a screwdriver.

# Conclusion
My final outcome, although might look crude and not exactly 100% finished, is something that I am proud of making, especially since I managed to put the motion sensor onto it, which can work with the code I wrote. Huge thanks to my mentor, Jay, for helping me with this project, and I hope I can take a bluestamp course again in the future.
